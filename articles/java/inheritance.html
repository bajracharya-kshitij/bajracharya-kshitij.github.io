    		Like father like son. Or like mother like daughter. Or ... you get the gist. There's a saying, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree", which roughly means that children are much like their parents. Just think about it for a minute, you must have at least one quality that either of your parent possesses. It's either because you were taught these qualities by your parents, like praying before you have a meal. Or because you saw your parents possess these qualities so much that you became influenced by them and now it's a part of who you are as well, like being inclined towards a particular sports team. Or just because these qualities were somehow passed on to your genes, like your ears turning red when you're really nervous. Whatever may be the case, the whole idea is that you possess some of the qualities of your parents - you <strong>inherited</strong> those qualities.

    		That is exactly what inheritance is - even in programming - a child class inherting the properties of a parent class. Of course a child can have their own set of qualities, like you may support a different sports team than either of your parents. In programming, we call this <strong>overriding</strong>. Or you might just have a new quality that neither of your parent possessed, like you might be an excellent painter while your parents can hardly draw an apple.
